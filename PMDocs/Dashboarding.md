# Dashboard Analytics Strategy for Site Manager Application

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** 2024  
**Owner:** Product Management  

## Executive Summary

The Site Manager application currently provides foundational dashboard capabilities with basic operational statistics. This document analyzes the current state and proposes enhanced analytics that would deliver significant value for pharmaceutical manufacturing operations from an industrial product manager perspective.

## Current Dashboard State Analysis

### Implemented Backend Analytics (via `/api/dashboard/stats/`)

**✅ Currently Available:**
- Total machine counts and status distribution
- Active serialization/aggregation machine tracking
- Work order status distribution and location-based analytics
- Work order creation trends (weekly intervals)
- Machine idle/active states and location distribution
- User count analytics
- Data received back to Site Manager tracking

**Frontend Implementation Gap:**
- Backend provides rich statistical data, but frontend currently only shows basic inbound/outbound order counts
- Significant opportunity to leverage existing backend analytics capabilities

### Data Sources Available for Enhanced Analytics

The application captures extensive operational data through:

```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN: Utilizing Existing Backend Statistics

### Current State Analysis

**✅ BACKEND READY:** The `/api/dashboard/stats/total/` endpoint provides comprehensive statistics:
```javascript
// Available Data Structure (already fetched by frontend)
{
  total_user_count: 25,
  total_workorders_count: 150,
  workorders_trend: [{name: "12-01", value: 23}, ...], // Weekly trends
  total_locations_count: 8,
  machines_count: 12,
  active_ser_machines: 3,
  active_agg_machines: 2,
  workorders_status_counts: [
    {name: "Created", value: 45},
    {name: "SRL and AGG in Progress", value: 12},
    {name: "Released", value: 93}
  ],
  workorders_location_counts: [{name: "Line 1", value: 35}, ...],
  workorders_by_location: [{name: "Line 1", value: 35, workorders: ["WO001", ...]}, ...],
  machine_location_counts: [{name: "Line 1", value: 4}, ...],
  machine_status_counts: {idle: 7, active: 5}
}
```

**✅ FRONTEND CONNECTED:** Dashboard service (`src/services/Dashboard.js`) already fetches this data
**✅ DATA MODEL READY:** `src/models/Dashboard.js` properly transforms the backend response
**🚨 MAJOR GAP:** Current UI only shows 2 basic statistics instead of leveraging 15+ available metrics

            <Pie
              data={data} // statistics.workOrderStatus
              cx="50%"
              cy="50%"
              labelLine={false}
              outerRadius={80}
              fill="#8884d8"
              dataKey="value"
            >
              {data.map((entry, index) => (
                <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={COLORS[index % COLORS.length]} />
              ))}
            </Pie>
            <Tooltip />
            <Legend />
          </PieChart>

### Manufacturing Scenarios: Real-World Use Cases

#### Scenario 1: Morning Production Meeting
**Context:** Daily 8 AM production review meeting

**Before Phase 0:**
```
Production Manager: "How many work orders do we have today?"
Assistant: "Let me check the system... I see some inbound and outbound numbers..."
Production Manager: "What about machine status? Any issues?"
Assistant: "I'll need to call the floor..."
Result: 15-minute delay, incomplete information
```

**After Phase 0:**
```
Production Manager opens dashboard:
✅ 47 Total Work Orders (↑ 12% vs yesterday)
✅ 8/12 Machines Active (3 SRL, 2 AGG, 3 Idle)
✅ Line 2 has 60% of work orders (potential bottleneck)
✅ Trending up 15% this week

Decision made in 30 seconds with complete visibility
```

#### Scenario 2: Equipment Failure Response
**Context:** Machine goes offline during production

**Before Phase 0:**
- Manual investigation to determine impact
- Phone calls to assess work order redistribution
- No visibility into which orders are affected

**After Phase 0:**
- Immediate dashboard view shows 3 active work orders on failed machine
- Location distribution chart reveals alternative machines available
- Status overview guides redistribution decisions
- Recovery time reduced from 45 minutes to 10 minutes

### Success Metrics for Phase 0
- Dashboard user engagement increase (target: 200%+)
- Time to find operational information (target: 80% reduction)
- User satisfaction with dashboard usefulness (baseline establishment)
- Foundation readiness for advanced analytics (Phase 1+)
