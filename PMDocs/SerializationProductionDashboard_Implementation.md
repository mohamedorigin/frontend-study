import SerializationProductionDashboard from "../dashboard/components/SerializationProductionDashboard";

// Verify component is added to Grid
<Grid item xs={12}>
  <SerializationProductionDashboard />
</Grid>
```

#### 2. Charts Not Rendering
- Verify recharts library is installed: `npm install recharts`
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure data structure matches expected format

#### 3. Mock Data Not Updating
- Check useEffect dependencies
- Verify setTimeout is not being cleared prematurely
- Confirm state updates are triggering re-renders

#### 4. Styling Issues
- Verify Material-UI theme is properly configured
- Check for CSS conflicts with global styles
- Ensure responsive breakpoints are working correctly

### Performance Issues
- **Large Datasets:** Implement pagination for tables with >1000 rows
- **Slow Rendering:** Use React.memo for chart components
