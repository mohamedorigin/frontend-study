# Site Manager Application - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Summary
**Site Manager** is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade pharmaceutical site management system designed to orchestrate packaging operations, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain end-to-end product traceability. This full-stack application serves as a Level 3 (Site Level) system that bridges enterprise systems (MES/ERP) with shop-floor manufacturing equipment, ensuring GMP compliance and supporting global serialization mandates (DSCSA, FMD).
